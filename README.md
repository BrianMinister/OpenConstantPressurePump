Open Constant Pressure Pump
===========================

Open Constant Pressure Pump - inspired by projects that promote opensource medical equipment. 

This is my version of a CPAP, which is based on a squirrel cage fan, like what is in your bathroom exhaust fan. 

Keep it cheap, keep it free (as in free of restrictions).
